\chapter{Generative AI Usage Declaration}
\label{sec:appendix_genai}

We acknowledge that generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek, were used to assist in the preparation of this thesis.

We mainly utilized generative AI tools in the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reviewing and understanding related literature,
	\item Generating ideas for our methodology,
	\item Outlining sections of the document, and
	\item Refining the style and organization of our writing.
\end{itemize}

While generative AI was used to support the creation of this document, we ensured that all output was thoroughly reviewed and evaluated. The final content, structure, and arguments presented in this thesis reflect our collective intellectual work and critical judgment. We take full responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, and interpretation of the material presented.

IMPORTANT -- READ THIS PART!!!

Please follow the instructions below on how to include the Research Ethics documents 
in your proposal document (typeset using LaTeX):

1. Open, and accomplish the contents of the THREE Word DOCX files included in the distribution

2. Once you're done filling in the necessary items, save the file in PDF format.  This is done by clicking on "File", 
    then "Save As" and then choose PDF (not DOCX default option) .  Do this for the three documents.

   The filenames are long, so I renamed the files with shorter names: 
       a . clearance.PDF  (original was GradSchool-revised ethics clearance form)
       b. general_checklist.PDF (original was General Research Ethics Checklist)
       c.  checklist-A PDF (original was [Specific Checklists] Checklist A - Human Participants]
