Most known personality test followed by people is Myer Briggs Test Indicator. While these tests are conducted by psychologists, it is very easy to deceive them in order to get the personality type of our choice, as these questions are very straight forward. This paper focuses on automating this task with the help of Neural Networks by using images instead of questions. A labelled dataset with user responses on social media along with their personality type is used for analysis. After cleaning, relevant response features are extracted using NLP followed by applying suitable classification algorithms. A model is trained to accurately predict the personality type of users based on their responses, which is then deployed on an interactive website in the form of a personality test.}, booktitle={2020 Second International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA)}, author={Pradhan, Tejas and Bhansali, Rashi and Chandnani, Dimple and Pangaonkar, Aditya}, year={2020}, month=july, pages={457–461} }

 	title={Convolutional Bi-LSTM for Automatic Personality Recognition From Social Media Texts}, 
 	volume={13}, 
 	ISSN={2169-3536}, 
 	DOI={10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3558714}, 
 	abstractNote={Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) has received much attention in recent years due to its wide range of important applications across various fields. The growing use of online social networks provides valuable opportunities for APR, as a strong correlation has been found between what users post on these platforms and their personality traits. Consequently, various APR models have been developed to infer the Big Five personality traits from social media user-generated texts. However, most of these models heavily relied on hand-crafted features, which are unable to capture deep contextual information and learn complex patterns from texts. More importantly, the performance of text-based APR is still unsatisfactory, especially at the level of each personality dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a new model, called APR_ConvLSTM, that aims to improve text-based APR performance by integrating two robust deep learning architectures: CNN and Bi-LSTM. Unlike existing APR models, the APR_ConvLSTM is a unified end-to-end model where all personality traits are predicted simultaneously and effectively without a need for laborious feature engineering. We also developed a new labeled Big Five personality dataset, called X-Big5, which has been in need for a long time in the APR field. Extensive experiments on the X-Big5 and a publicly available benchmark dataset (PAN-2015 Author Profiling) demonstrate the promising performance of our model over its contenders. Overall, the proposed model achieved the highest Accuracy and F-1 score of 79.51% and 86.54% on the PAN-2015 dataset and 87.95% and 81.35%, respectively, on the X-Big5 dataset. Moreover, it shows promising performance over its competitors, with the highest average Accuracy and F-1 score of 79.01% and 80.56%, respectively, on the combined dataset. The model reached competitive results in predicting Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism traits with the highest F1 scores of 88.60%, 77.35%, 76.16%, and 74.52%, respectively, on the combined dataset. The proposed model can positively impact the analysis of social media text generated by different users and help identify their personality traits.},

	DOI={10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558116}, 
	abstractNote={This study introduces an Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) model, named XLNet refined-highway-switch network, comprising XLNet, refined highway units, a switching module, and a fully-connected layer. The pretrained XLNet is employed to extract semantic features from text. The refined highway units with the dense connections are explored. Additionally, our study delves into the optimized computation structures between the refined highway and switching module to unearth personality- related features. Notably, this APR model incorporates punctuation and stop words in text, resulting in a notable accuracy boost of up to 6.79%. Through extensive experiments on the integrated datasets which combine My Personality, Essays, and Friends Persona, the proposed model achieves the best average accuracies of64.79% and 64.43% for Big-5 personality traits on English and Chinese versions, respectively, as compared to conventional models. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed APR model in a retrieval-based chatbot, utilizing Jaccard distance to select the most suitable personality responses for interactions, yielding promising results in subject tests. Consequently, the proposed APR model can be widely used in various personalized applications related to personality traits.},

    abstractNote={This study aimed to construct a novel multimodal model by fusing different electroencephalogram (EEG) data sources, which were under neutral, negative and positive audio stimulation, to discriminate between depressed patients and normal controls. The EEG data of different modalities were fused using a feature-level fusion technique to construct a depression recognition model. The EEG signals of 86 depressed patients and 92 normal controls were recorded simultaneously while receiving different audio stimuli. Then, from the EEG signals of each modality, linear and nonlinear features were extracted and selected to obtain features of each modality. In addition, a linear combination technique was used to fuse the EEG features of different modalities to build a global feature vector and find several powerful features. Furthermore, genetic algorithms were used to perform feature weighting to improve the overall performance of the recognition framework. The classification accuracy of each classifier, namely the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM), was compared, and the results were encouraging. The highest classification accuracy of 86.98% was obtained by the KNN classifier in the fusion of positive and negative audio stimuli, demonstrating that the fusion modality could achieve higher depression recognition accuracy rate compared with the individual modality schemes. This study may provide an additional tool for identifying depression patients.},

    abstractNote={Automated recognition of human activities or actions has great significance as it incorporates wide-ranging applications, including surveillance, robotics, and personal health monitoring. Over the past few years, many computer vision-based methods have been developed for recognizing human actions from RGB and depth camera videos. These methods include space-time trajectory, motion encoding, key poses extraction, space-time occupancy patterns, depth motion maps, and skeleton joints. However, these camera-based approaches are affected by background clutter and illumination changes and applicable to a limited field of view only. Wearable inertial sensors provide a viable solution to these challenges but are subject to several limitations such as location and orientation sensitivity. Due to the complementary trait of the data obtained from the camera and inertial sensors, the utilization of multiple sensing modalities for accurate recognition of human actions is gradually increasing. This paper presents a viable multimodal feature-level fusion approach for robust human action recognition, which utilizes data from multiple sensors, including RGB camera, depth sensor, and wearable inertial sensors. We extracted the computationally efficient features from the data obtained from RGB-D video camera and inertial body sensors. These features include densely extracted histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features from RGB/depth videos and statistical signal attributes from wearable sensors data. The proposed human action recognition (HAR) framework is tested on a publicly available multimodal human action dataset UTD-MHAD consisting of 27 different human actions. K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers are used for training and testing the proposed fusion model for HAR. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves better recognition results as compared to the state of the art. The feature-level fusion of RGB and inertial sensors provides the overall best performance for the proposed system, with an accuracy rate of 97.6%.},

    abstractNote={In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

With the advancement of computer vision technology, there has been significant enhancement in personality computing. Personality trait recognition is one of the applications under personality computing where the machine can analyze human behaviors and recognize personality traits via video analysis. In video input, there are different audio-visual features characteristics, consisting of visual (images) and audio (sounds) elements. Therefore, it is critical to employ appropriate deep learning techniques to most effectively extract important features from audio-visual input. The maturity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been proven with promising prediction results for feature extraction and selection in image classification, sound detection, and face-emotion recognition. Thus, a variety of CNN-based techniques have been developed with different salient features and CNN layer modifications to learn and extract meaningful patterns and representations from images and videos. Due to the distinct characteristics of audio-visual features, hybrid CNN-based techniques were introduced to optimally analyze these modalities. This study aimed to explore hybrid CNN-based techniques used in video analysis for personality trait recognition systems. This study also provides an overview of current issues in the development of recognition models in personality computing using hybrid CNN-based techniques. The advantages of integrating audio and visual modalities in hybrid techniques are addressed, as well as their performance accuracy. The discussion finally summarizes the findings and potential future research directions.}, number={11}, journal={International Journal of Innovative Computing}, author={Amin, Nurrul Akma Mahamad and Sjarif, Nilam Nur Amir and Yuhaniz, Siti Sophiayati}, year={2025}, month=may, pages={45–52}, language={en} }

In addition, taking into account the model efficiency, we extract audio representations and build the linear regressor for the audio modality. For combining the complementary information from the two modalities, we ensemble these predicted regression scores by both early fusion and late fusion.

    abstractNote={Pedestrians, as the most vulnerable road users in traffic crashes, prompt transportation researchers and urban planners to prioritize pedestrian safety due to the elevated risk and growing incidence of injuries and fatalities. Thorough pedestrian crash data are indispensable for safety research, as the most detailed descriptions of crash scenes and pedestrian actions are typically found in crash narratives and diagrams. However, extracting and analyzing this information from police crash reports poses significant challenges. This study tackles these issues by introducing innovative image-processing techniques to analyze crash diagrams. By employing cutting-edge technological methods, the research aims to uncover and extract hidden features from pedestrian crash data in Michigan, thereby enhancing the understanding and prevention of such incidents. This study evaluates the effectiveness of three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures—VGG-19, AlexNet, and ResNet-50—in classifying multiple hidden features in pedestrian crash diagrams. These features include intersection type (three-leg or four-leg), road type (divided or undivided), the presence of marked crosswalk (yes or no), intersection angle (skewed or unskewed), the presence of Michigan left turn (yes or no), and the presence of nearby residentials (yes or no). The research utilizes the 2020–2023 Michigan UD-10 pedestrian crash reports, comprising 5437 pedestrian crash diagrams for large urbanized areas and 609 for rural areas. The CNNs underwent comprehensive evaluation using various metrics, including accuracy and F1-score, to assess their capacity for reliably classifying multiple pedestrian crash features. The results reveal that AlexNet consistently surpasses other models, attaining the highest accuracy and F1-score. This highlights the critical importance of choosing the appropriate architecture for crash diagram analysis, particularly in the context of pedestrian safety. These outcomes are critical for minimizing errors in image classification, especially in transportation safety studies. In addition to evaluating model performance, computational efficiency was also considered. In this regard, AlexNet emerged as the most efficient model. This understanding is precious in situations where there are limitations on computing resources. This study contributes novel insights to pedestrian safety research by leveraging image processing technology, and highlights CNNs’ potential use in detecting concealed pedestrian crash patterns. The results lay the groundwork for future research, and offer promise in supporting safety initiatives and facilitating countermeasures’ development for researchers, planners, engineers, and agencies.},

The quality measure of the modalities data is used for fuzzification. Two modifications of the FKM and FVQ algorithms, based on a fuzzy vector distance definition, are proposed to handle the fuzzy data and utilize the quality measure. Simulations show that fuzzy clustering algorithms have better performance compared to the classical clustering algorithms and other known fusion algorithms. MRBF has better performance especially when two modalities are combined. Moreover, the use of the quality via the proposed modified algorithms increases the performance of the fusion system.},

	abstract = {Adaptive e-learning can be used to personalize learning environment for students to meet their individual demands. Individual differences depend on the students' personality traits. Numerous studies have indicated that understanding the role of personality in the learning process can facilitate learning. Hence, personality identification in e-learning is a critical issue in education. In this study, we propose the enhanced extended nearest neighbor (EENN) algorithm to automatically identify two of the Big Five personality traits from students' behavior in online learning: openness to experience and extraversion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a fivefold cross-validation approach on data from 662 senior high school students. The experimental results indicate that the EENN method can automatically recognize personality at an average accuracy of 0.758. The optimized method that combines EENN with particle swarm optimization significantly improves the identification, resulting in an average accuracy of 0.976. The results can benefit students by increasing the accuracy of personalization based on their personality traits, while simultaneously allowing them to be better understood and possibly allowing their instructors to provide more appropriate learning interventions.},

	abstract = {Personality can be defined as the combination of behavior, emotion, motivation, and thoughts that aim at describing various aspects of human behavior based on a few stable and measurable characteristics. Considering the fact that our personality has a remarkable influence in our daily life, automatic recognition of a person's personality attributes can provide many essential practical applications in various aspects of cognitive science. deep learning based method for the task of personality recognition from text is proposed in this paper. Among various deep neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated profound efficiency in natural language processing and especially personality detection. Owing to the fact that various filter sizes in CNN may influence its performance, we decided to combine CNN with AdaBoost, a classical ensemble algorithm, to consider the possibility of using the contribution of various filter lengths and gasp their potential in the final classification via combining various classifiers with respective filter size using AdaBoost. Our proposed method was validated on the Essay dataset by conducting a series of experiments and the empirical results demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method compared to both machine learning and deep learning methods for the task of personality recognition.},

Finally, different machine learning approaches were used to test the effectiveness of these features in predicting personality and interaction style traits.

	abstract = {Recent studies in the field of text-based personality recognition experiment with different languages, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning algorithms to create better and more accurate models; however, little focus is placed on exploring the language use of a group of individuals defined by nationality. Individuals of the same nationality share certain practices and communicate certain ideas that can become embedded into their natural language. Many nationals are also not limited to speaking just one language, such as how Filipinos speak Filipino and English, the two national languages of the Philippines. The addition of several regional/indigenous languages, along with the commonness of code-switching, allow for a Filipino to have a rich vocabulary. This presents an opportunity to create a text-based personality model based on how Filipinos speak, regardless of the language they use. To do so, data was collected from 250 Filipino Twitter users. Different combinations of data processing techniques were experimented upon to create personality models for each of the Big Five. The results for both regression and classification show that Conscientiousness is consistently the easiest trait to model, followed by Extraversion. Classification models for Agreeableness and Neuroticism had subpar performances, but performed better than those of Openness. An analysis on personality trait score representation showed that classifying extreme outliers generally produce better results for all traits except for Neuroticism and Openness.},

	abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content.  One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans.  Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications.  However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits.  This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality.  While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

Motivated by the fact that detection of significant features is an essential part of a personality recognition system, we present in this paper an in-depth analysis of audio visual, text, demographic and sentiment features for classification of multi-modal personality traits namely, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness to experience. We use the YouTube personality data set and use logistic regression model with a ridge estimator for the classification purpose. We experiment with audio-visual features, bag of word features, sentiment based and demographic features.

The researchers in the field of computer science have found in the social media platforms an easier way achieve these studies. As they are widespread and used by most individuals. Social media enables people to share most of their thoughts, feelings and daily activities. Researches all-over the world tried to use that rich source of data to predict personality traits in many different languages, but none of them have tried to work with the Arabic language. Although Arab social media users represent a large sector of social media users. This paper introduces AraPersonality. A Personality traits dataset that was gathered from Egyptian dialect twitter users. It is consisted of about 92 users twitter feeds. This paper discusses how it was gathered, its properties, statistics and experiments, its experimental results can be considered the baseline. The average of the best result in each trait is 0.59 and 0.33 in binary and multiclass representation respectively according to f1-score. These results can be considered as a good start for a system that predict personality for Egyptian users.},

This study investigates platform-swinging among older adults, where they strategically switch between platforms to fulfill specific needs and desires. We interviewed 11 older adults living in the Philippines in November of 2023 who used at least two social media platforms. The platform combination favored by older adults varies based on their context. However, a common combination observed in this study included Facebook, Messenger, and YouTube. Guided by the Uses and Gratification Theory, we applied thematic analysis and revealed four major themes that motivate older adults to practice platform-swinging: managing digital ties, transferring information, uplifting and managing emotions, and optimizing work processes. The respondents' ability to practice platform-swinging is facilitated by adequate internet connectivity and devices, and familiarity with the different platforms.",

               understanding of the issues in the country and their engagement

               investigate the relationship between exposure to social media to
               the awareness on various social issues and the complex political
               involvement of youth. The study employed a correlational design
               of quantitative research approach use to analyze data gathered
               based on the conducted online survey of senior high school
               students from Tanauan City Integrated High School. In addition,
               this study applied a Pearson correlation to determine if a
               significant correlation existed. Findings showed that there is
               no significant connection between the respondents' social media
               exposure and their level of awareness regarding societal issues
               in the country. On the other hand, there is a significant
               relationship between the respondents' social media exposure and
               their level of radical involvement. This research demonstrates
               how a broader and more advanced understanding of youth's radical
               political participation associated with more comprehensive
               measures of social media use can help better understand the role
               of digital platforms in influencing political participatory
               behavior and awareness among the internet generation. It is
               recommendable that future researchers could focus on a different
               aspect, highlighting the effects of specific social media
               platform to bring in-depth information about its implications to

    abstract="Instagram is a popular social networking application, which allows photo-sharing and applying different photo filters to adjust the appearance of a picture. By applying these filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience. In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users manipulate the appearance of their pictures by applying filters to them. To investigate this relationship, we studied the relationship between picture features and personality traits. To collect data, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API. Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., relevant to hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits. Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and these picture features. Based on our findings, we also show that personality traits can be accurately predicted. This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.",

               investigation into idealized online self-presentation",
  author    = "Harris, Elspbeth and Bardey, Aurore C",
  abstract  = "Instagram users are consistently exposed to the presentation of
               idealized selves. Although studies have examined online
               self-presentation in general, little attention has been paid to
               self-presentation in a visual online setting, such as Instagram.
               The present investigation examined the extent to which Instagram
               account holders engage in idealized online self-presentation
               through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative results (Study 1)
               showed a difference between how the observers perceived the
               Instagram account holders' personality and the Instagram account
               holders' personality self-reports. Qualitative findings (Study
               2) revealed four major themes: (1) Selfies as a personality
               predictor; (2) Faces as a personality predictor; (3) Layout as
               personality predictor, (4) Misuse of social networks and its
               consequence for communication. Our results also indicated that
               the halo effect is integral to the online self-presentational
               process, suggesting that an aesthetically pleasing Instagram
               account or account holder will be better received and thought as
               having particularly positive personality traits.",
