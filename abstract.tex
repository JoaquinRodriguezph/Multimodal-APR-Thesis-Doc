Filipino Automatic Personality Recognition (APR) is a growing field focused on recognizing personality traits within the Filipino population. Current studies have primarily explored the textual modality, particularly content from X (formerly Twitter). However, prior research has shown that using both visual and linguistic cues jointly enhances trait prediction accuracy, and Instagram was identified as a viable source of multimodal data. This presents an opportunity to explore a multimodal approach in the context of Filipino APR using Instagram data in order to improve upon existing models. Given this, we created an Instagram data-based multimodal APR framework for Filipino users, combining image features with bilingual (English/Tagalog) text analysis to advance beyond unimodal approaches. Our methodology utilizes classification models with feature-level fusion of image, text, and metadata features. It aims to compare unimodal and multimodal performance on the Big Five traits while following ethical guidelines established in the PagkataoKo Dataset.
